<p>Some alternatives were presented to me then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window functions (e.g. Hamming window)</li>
<li>Matched filter</li>
<li>Wiener filter</li>
<li>Dynamic time warping</li>
<li>Matlab&rsquo;s MA Toolbox audio similarity measure</li>
<li>Support vector machine</li>
<li>Blind source separation (e.g. Independent component analysis)</li>
<li>Hidden Markov Model</li>
<li>Naive Bayes Classifier</li>
<li>Autocorrelation via recursive least squares filter</li>
</ul>
<p>Then in 2022 I finally came accross a solution involving neural networks: recurrent variants (LSTM/GRU) that can be paired with one or two convolutional layers (CNN), with the CNN layer operating on a few frames of FFT-transformed audio.</p>
