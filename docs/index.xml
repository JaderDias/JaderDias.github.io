      <description>With Apkpure we can download the binaries and resources from any Android application on the Play Store. That&amp;rsquo;s very interesting if you want to re-use some of its assets.
Suppose you need a list of all the words in English and their translation to Spanish. It could be cumbersome to crawl a translation website or make your app depend on a Translation API for such a task. An alternative is to look for an Android app that has an English to Spanish dictionary and re-use their assets.</description>
